# One Line Python Tic Tac Toe

tictactoe3.8.py is the one-line version, however it only works in python 3.8, as it takes advantage of the python3.8 walrus operator (:=).

The other file, tictactoe.py is the lowest number of lines I was able to achieve without the walrus operator, but its still a work in progress.
